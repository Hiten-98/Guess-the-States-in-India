# Guess-the-States-in-India

This is a fun Quiz Game in which a user has to guess all the states of India. User will get 3 chances to complete this game. To make it more graphical and user friendly I have added India's map using Turtle Graphics in Python.

To complete this challege I have used pandas library. Pandas library helps us to work with .csv files. 
In csv file I have mentioned all the states and their x and y co-ordinate in India's map.

Now when the game starts a dialouge appears and user have to enter name of the state. And if the answer is correct than that particular answer will go to the exact location of the state India map image which I have used.
